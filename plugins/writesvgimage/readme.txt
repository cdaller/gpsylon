This is a GPSMap plugin that allows the user to save the current map
as an svg image.

To install the plugin, copy the jar file and the lib directory to the
plugin directory of GPSMap. Start GPSMap and the "Save As" menu should
give the possibility to save as SVG.

This is a pre release, so do not expect too much!
