ChangeLog for GPSMap (http://gpsmap.sourceforge.net)

2003/01/24: plugin architecture is finished, downloadmousemode
            changed. Plugin things need further testing (GuiPlugin and
            LayerPlugin with menus are not tested at all (there are no
            GuiPlugins/LayerPlugins at the moment :-))

	    added targets to build.xml file: src_dist, bin_dist,
            javadoc, .... build.xml should do most of the things it is
            supposed to.

2003/01/16: added GuiPlugin, LayerPlugin, MouseModePlugin. Added
            implementation of MouseModePlugin that supports zoom
            in/out.

            Plugin things not finished yet, but seems to work ok.

2003/01/09: added plugin functionality (any jars in a given directory
            are used as plugins).

2003/01/07: fixed bug (reported by Thomas Mueller): import of location
            markers did not work.

            improved service for reading track data: if no services
            are found, the menu entry is disabled.

2003/01/06: added service for reading track data, still some bugs, but
            works basically.

2002/12/31: calculate heading, if gps device does not provide it.

            fixed small bug in printHelp/Usage

2002/12/20: version 0.4.13 released

2002/12/19: bug fix (reported from Jun Li): if the map layer was
            deactivated, no maps were displyed on startup. 

            Added service (plugin) functionality for "save as". At the
            moment, jpg and png is supported. A svg service is done,
            but needs some other jars, and I dont know how to include
            them easily.

2002/12/14: double click in search list (markers) jumps to chosen
            entry.

            postgresql works now (confirmed by Thomas Mueller)

2002/12/13: fixed bug that ignored the gpsd port settings (default
            port was always used) (reported by Adam Coyne)

2002/12/12: fixed bug that prevented correct writing of location
            marker file (instead of the comma, its deciaml value (44)
            was written.

2002/12/11: fixed bug reported by Jun Li in
            org.dinopolis.gpstool.util.FileUtil: the filenames were
            not correctly created.

2002/12/08: added javadoc to src distribution

            added design document to documentation

2002/12/03: added search dialog for location marker

            fixed bug in algorithm that decides which maps are visible
            (added case 15 and 16 in
            org.dinopolis.gpstool.gui.util.VisibleImage)

            changed factor when to display next small map from 0.25 to
            0.6 (means, that the factor (scale of the map divided by
            the scale used at the moment) must be greater or equal
            0.6, so only maps that are close to the current scale are
            shown. This results in much better readability of the
            maps! Made this factor configurable in the resources.

            version 0.4.12 released

2002/11/21: added login dialog for other dbs than hsqldb (e.g. mysql).
            if the mysql database exists (mysqladmin create <dbname>),
            the tables should be created automatically.

            Added lots of keyboard accelerators and menu mnemonics.

            Removed the scale combobox from the status bar (better?
            solution in menu, accessible directly via accelerator
            keys).

            version 0.4.11 released

2002/11/20: sorted the categories in the category dialog, added level
            of detail to be edited.

            Import of compressed geonet files is possible (zip and txt.gz)

            Dialogbox if maps.txt file is not found.

            Some tests under win98se.

2002/11/19: added concept of "level of detail" to categories, made a
            dialog to choose the categories to show

2002/11/17: changed the creation of the MapBean a bit, so the
            projection does not change that often anymore (everytime
            it changes, the location marker layer searches in the db
            for markers.

2002/11/15: release 0.4.9 did not contain the script to create the
            database. so version 0.4.10 was released to fix this bug!
            
            added lots of icons

            added import of location markers (gpsdrive and geonet
            files)

            version 0.4.10 released

2002/11/13: added "center map" with coordinates

            added selection of categories for markers

            added optional category as fourth column in loading
            location markers files

            cleaned up the properties file (removed buggy entries,
            added descriptions, etc.)

            made color and size of location markers editable (and
            working :-)

            version 0.4.9 released

2002/11/11: bugfix: displaying more than one location marker source
            was buggy!

2002/11/08: added category handling, filters for jdbc location
            markers, and icons for the category of the location marker

2002/11/05: allow arbitrary (but checked for valid format) lat/long
            input in dialog of location marker and download map
            dialogs.

2002/11/04: added adding of location markers to default file (csv).

            changed the build.xml file around (fixed a bug in the
            build.xml file that is packed with the distributions 
     
            version 0.4.8 released

2002/10/31: bug fix in track layer: cancel button in load track
            resulted in nullpointer exception

            added "save as..." functionality (jpg and png supported)

2002/10/30: added reading csv and gpsdrive waypoints files. 

2002/10/29: started to implement the locationlayer from scratch (not
            using the openmap layer)

2002/10/25: allow configuration of the "ignore nmea checksum" 

            version 0.4.7 released

2002/10/24: added text for graticule lines

            changed resource editor (remembers size/pos, is created in
            background (opens much faster now!), some other minor
            bugfixes)

2002/10/23: added dialog for lock-file removal (or ignore them) for
            the serial port lock files. as I found out later, this is
            only a problem on suse 8.0 as on this system, a symbolic
            link from /var/spool/locks to /var/lock exists and rxtx is
            not prepared to see its lock file in this foreign
            directory. After having removed the link, rxtx deletes
            stale lock files on itself.

            added window for viewing gps data (nmea).

2002/10/22: several bugfixes: some settings were forgot when
            application closed (follow me mode, display track mode,
            gps position, window size, ...), gps speed is displayed
            now (not calculated speed)

            GraticuleLayer is completely rewritten (does not only
            extend the Graticulelayer of openmap).

            FlatProjection extends Orthographic now, not Cylindrical
            anymore

            version 0.4.6 released

2002/10/18: detect and display lost gps signal (gpsdevice out of
            battery...)
            version 0.4.5 released

2002/10/17: scale layer draws rule for current scale
            bug fix in distance/speed unit for nautical 
            version 0.4.4 released

2002/10/16: added progress bars for downloads
            better behaviour for download areas (visual feedback)
            version 0.4.3 released

2002/10/15: fixed bug in position icon (direction was not updated)
            added progress bar in statusbar for painting activity
            added display for satellite activity
            fixed bug, so now all gps events are received by gpsmap
            version 0.4.2 released

2002/10/12: fixed bug in projection (overflow of latitude)

2002/10/10: finally got the position icon into the direction of heading!
            added shapefile support (multiple files can be loaded)

2002/10/09: new image drawing algorithm works now (only the parts
            of the visible images are drawn, not all image layers (all scales)).
            Most calculation of layers is done in background now (SwingWorker)

2002/10/02: track loading of gpsdrive tracks works

2002/10/01: track loading works (gpsdrive tracks not yet!)

2002/09/27: bugfix: delay in gpsreading was set when a
            nmea log file was written, not when a nmea file was read. this
            resulted in lost serial data and therefore in many checksum errors
            and so on.

2002/09/26: started "load track" functionality

2002/09/25: Fix in GPSNmea handling. added nmea checksum, better
            handling of broken GSV sentences added methods to show altitude in
            feet and units for speed, distance, and altitude
            tracks can be written to disc
            map name convention changed
            FileUtil class added

2002/09/24: FlatProjection is set directly into mapbean, so patch
              of ProjectionFactory is obsolete.
            bufixes
            
2002/09/23: moved java classes into packages in org.dinopolis.gpstool
            created ant-build.xml file
            TrackLayer displays tracks (save not yet done)

2002/09/22: bugfixes in GPS module (nmea log file, empty sentences ...)
            added GSV, GGA, RMC sentences in gpstool, added more events
            (speed, satellite infos, ...)

2002/09/20: expedia works now (scale was not adopted to uneven expedia scales)
            download of areas works (array of images)
            made the image a weak reference
            
2002/09/19: added download of position
            added support for different map servers (expedia and mapblast)
            made urls configurable in resource files
            changed download dialog completely (no lat/lon to input, only per click on map)

2002/09/17: nmea log file support added (not tested yet!)

2002/09/11: removed mapHandler, added MapMouseMode
            (distance works), added methods to calculate distance and return
            correct distance in km,miles,nautic miles

2002/09/11: download works for single maps

2002/09/10: lat/lon/heading output format
