GPSMap / gpstool
================

GPSMap is a moving map application that may use data from a gpsdevice
to show the current location. It uses the gpstool framework that
provides some classes for geographical and cartographical programming.

To start the application, you need java1.4, for gps support you need
serial support (the comm api from sun or third party support).

Usually, you can start GPSMap by calling

java -jar gpstool.jar

Further details are in the html-documentation in the "doc" directory
where you can also find a software design documentation for your own
extensions to the code.

The latest version may be downloaded at http://gpsmap.sourceforge.net

GPSMap uses some features of the open-source (GPL) openmap library.
