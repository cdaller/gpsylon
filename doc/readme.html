      The dinopolis gpstool package is an open source (LGPL) Java GPS
      application.  It consists of different modules that may be used as a
      programmer's framework or as an application. The main application is
      <a href="#general_description">GPSylon</a>. A smaller command line tool is
      <a href="#gpstool">GPSTool</a>.

      <h2>News</h2>
      <p>
        2003/05/12:<br>
        As the name GPSMap is already used by several other projects/products, the main
        application is renamed to GPSylon.<br>
      </p>

    <a name="general_description">
      <h2>Short Description of GPSylon</h2>

   <p>
    GPSylon is able to show maps downloaded from the 
    <a href="http://www.mapblast.com">mapblast</a>
    or 
    <a href="http://www.expedia.com">expedia</a>
    map servers. It may connect
    to
    a gps device and track your position on 
    the maps. At the moment, it is able to read gpsdata in the NMEA
    standard from a serial gps device, a file or a gps daemon across a
    network (available at the 
    <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/gpsd/">gpsd project page</a>).
   </p>
          
          <p>
          The main feature is the display of various maps. GPSylon allows the
          user to navigate around like in a digital atlas. It shows maps of
          different scales, so missing maps of one scale do not result in a
          black screen, but show the next larger scale. See <a
          href=" screenshots.html#diffscales">the screenshot section</a> for an
        image. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        It allows the download of a single map or for a given location or for multiple
        maps in a given rectangular area from mapblast or expedia map
	servers. In the download mouse mode the user may choose a single map or
	by dragging a rectangle with the mouse, the user may choose to download
	maps for a larger area. This functionality allows the user to download
	maps in a given scale for a larger area. Please only download maps you
	need and be careful not to download thousands of maps, as the map
	providers will discontinue their service when it is misused! 
      </p>

      <p>
        It uses the open source library <a href="http://openmap.bbn.com">openmap</a> for various cartographic
        things.   
      </p>

      <h3>Features</h3>
      The following features are implemented.
      <ul>
        <li>Display different maps from mapblast or expedia server (also for
          maps of different scale).</li>
        <li>Display current position (gps position).</li>
        <li>Read gps data from serial device, file, or gpsd (daemon).</li>
        <li>Uses the following NMEA sentences: GLL, HDG, RMC, GGA, GSV, DBT, VTG, HTD.</li>
        <li>Display a track from gps data.</li>
        <li>Save the track.</li>
        <li>Load a track created from GPSylon or from <a href="http://gpsdrive.kraftvoll.at">gpsdrive</a>.</li>
        <li>Import maps from gpsdrive.</li>
        <li>Download a map for a given position.</li>
        <li>Download maps for an area.</li>
        <li>Measure distance (ruler).</li>
        <li>Read and display shape files (very basic, not well tested!).</li>
        <li>display graticule lines</li>
        <li>window to display the raw nmea data</li>
        <li>
         Location Marker support: (creating markers, load markers from files (comma
         or space
         separated (name, latitude, longitude [,category]) - in that order!)),
         export markers to csv files, icons for categories, import geonet data
          (available from <a
            href="http://164.214.2.59/gns/html/index.html">http://164.214.2.59/gns/html/index.html</a>) 
        </li>
         <li>Database support for Location Markers - selection of categories to
          display</li>
        <li>Level Of Detail: depending on the chosen scale, not all location
          markers are displayed. The level of detail is increased when the user
          zooms in or chooses to override the level of detail. This behaviour
          might be tricky, when the user creates a location marker in a
          category that does not show due to its higher level of detail. So the
          user may not see the newly created marker.</li>
        <li>Search for location markers and set the center of the map
          to a search result. This is extremely useful in combination with the
          geonet data. So, after importing the geonet data, one is able to
          search for very small villages or other points of interest. When
          using mysql or postgresql as a database, the lookup for names of location markers
          is very fast, the (default) hsql database is about 5 to 10 times
          slower (but also works perfectly, just slower :-). So if one or more
          geonet files should be imported, I recommend mysql or postgresql (see in the
          <a href="#installation_database">installation section</a> for
          configuration details).</li>
      </ul>

        <a name="supported_devices">
          <h2>Supported GPS Devices</h2>
          <p>
            In general, all gps devices that support NMEA communication should
            work. Garmin protocol support is built in, but not very well tested.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were reports of the following devices to work with GPSylon:
            <ul>
              <li>Garmin Etrex Summit/Legend (NMEA/garmin modes) tested by myself)</li>
              <li>Trimble Lassen SK8 (NMEA mode) (reported by Didier Donsez)</li>
              <li>Garmin 35 (NMEA mode) (reported by Antonio)</li>
              <li>Conexant '99 embedded module (NMEA mode) (reported by Antonio)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
          <a name="installation">
            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <p>
              No installation of GPSylon itself is needed. Nevertheless, some dependencies
              exist:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Java in Version 1.4 is needed. It can be obtained from 
                  <a href="http://java.sun.com">Sun's Website</a>. Development is
                  currently done with version 1.4.1, but 1.4.0 should also work. Version
                  1.3 does NOT work!
                </li>
                <li>
                  Java Communications API is needed, if you want to access a serial gps
                  device directly (if the gps daemon is used or NMEA data is read from a
                  file, this is not necessary). For Windows use the package provided from
                  Sun at
                  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/index.html">the comm-api
                    webpage</a>. For Linux I used the package provided at 
                  <a href="http://www.rxtx.org">RXTX</a>. I used the version that uses
                  javax.comm, not the one using gnu.io (to stay compatible with Sun's
                  naming). 
                  <p>
                    Jan van Haarst reported that 
                    <a href="http://www.brianpoe.com/comfoolery/">comfoolery</a>
                    can be used to forward the serial data to a network socket. GPSylon may
                    connect to this socket when it is configured to use gpsd instead of
                    the serial device.
                  </p>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <a name="installation_database">
            <h3>Database for Location Markers</h3>
            <p>
              GPSylon is able to store and retrieve location markers from
              relational databases via JDBC. By default it uses the pure java
              open source <a href="http://hsqldb.sourceforge.net">Hypersonic
              DB (hsqldb)</a>. It has the advantage that no installation is needed and
              GPSylon creates a database on demand without any hassle.
            </p>
       <p>
        As the 
        <a href="http://164.214.2.59/gns/html/index.html">geonet dataset</a>
        is quite large (e.g. Austria 50 thousand entries, 
        Germany 170 thousand entries), hsqldb seemed quite slow. So I gave it a
        try with mysql and it seems to be faster! Especially
        searching for location markers is faster by a factor 5 to 10! So I
        added a script
        that creates the table(s) needed (syntax differs slightly from
        the hsqldb syntax). The following steps are needed to use a
        mysql database instead of the built in hsqldb:
        <ul>
         <li>Install MySQL :-)</li>
         <li>
          Create the database: e.g. with the command 
          <code>mysqladmin create gpsmap</code>
         </li>
         <li>Start GPSylon and edit database settings in the preferences
          (Location Marker tab):</li>
         <ul>
          <li>
           JDBC Url: <code>jdbc:mysql://localhost/gpsmap</code>
          </li>
          <li>
           JDBC Driver: <code>com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</code>
          </li>
          <li>
           SQL Script to create the Database:
           <code>sql/create_loation_mysql.sql</code>
          </li>
         </ul>
         <li>quit GPSylon</li>
         <li>on the next start, GPSylon tries to access the new database, but
          cannot (as the tables are missing). It asks for administrators
          username/password (try "root" and empty password :-) so it can create
          the table(s). It will also add a user "sa" with no password for
          normal usage (access limited to gpsmap database).</li>
         <li>That should be it! From now on, all location markers are stored
          and retrieved from the MySQL database.</li>
        </ul>
        For Postgresql support use the following configuration:
        <ul>
         <li>JDBC Url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost/gpsmap</li>
         <li>
          JDBC Driver: <code>org.postgresql.Driver</code>
         </li>
         <li>
          SQL Script to create the Database:
          <code>sql/create_loation_postgresql.sql</code>
         </li>
        </ul>
        The rest of the postgresql configuration is similar to the mysql
        configuration (install database, create a gpsmap database, create user
        and user rights, ...)
       </p>
            <a name="run_gpsmap">
              <h2>Run GPSylon</h2>
              <p>
                To start GPSylon, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64816">download</a> the gpstool-archive, unpack it and call<br> 
                  <code>java -jar gpssylon.jar</code><br> 
                    or if your environment is setup to handle jar-archives correctly, simply
                    double click on the jar-archive (should work under
                    windows). All needed classes are contained in the jar file. 
                    If you have the ant environment installed, call <code>ant run</code>.
              </p>
              <p>
                For commandline arguments (everything may be configured in the
                application as well!), call<br>
                  <code>java -jar gpsylon.jar --help</code><br> 
              </p>
	      <h3>Mouse Modes</h3>
	      GPSylon supports different mouse modes. Mouse modes may be added
	      as plugins. At the moment, two mouse modes are available:
	      <ul>
	      <li>Navigation Mode: click anywhere in the map to zoom in and
	      center at the clicked position. If the shift-key is held, a click
	      zooms out. More navigational functionality will be implemented
	      soon (pan, ...)</li>
	      <li>Download Mode: If the download mode is used, a window opens
	      that displays some information about the map(s) to download. In
	      the map window, a red rectangle (with crossed lines) shows the
	      current location and size (size may not be exact and varies
	      slightly from one internet map server to another). The user may
	      change the location either by clicking in the map or by changing
	      the coordinates in the download window. The coordinates may be
	      entered in different formats (decimal, using the degree sign,
	      etc.). The user may click and drag in the map to draw a
	      rectangle. If the rectangle is larger that a single map, more
	      than one rectangle is shown and the number of maps to download is
	      shown in the download window. Please do not download maps
	      excessively, as the companies that provide the maps do not like
	      that and will stop their service if it is misused!</li>
	      </ul>
	      <a name="plugins">
	       <h2>Plugins</h2>
	       <p>
	       GPSylon supports plugins of various kinds. The plugin-jars
	       are used without the need to set the
	       <code>CLASSPATH</code>. All jars in the directories
	       <code>[home]/.gpsmap/plugins</code> and in the
	       <code>plugins</code> directory of the applicaton are used.

                 GPSTool is a small command line application that demonstrates
                 the usage of the classes to read data from a gps device. The
                 main class is
                 <code>org.dinopolis.gpstool.gpsinput.GPSTool</code>
                 and it may
                 be started using the provided gpstool.jar file. Use "--help"
                 to see all commandline switches.<br>
                  The following features are implemented in GPSTool:
                  <ul>
                   <li>
                    Show current position/altitude/speed/heading/info about
                    satellites.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    Use NMEA or Garmin protocol.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    Download tracks, routes, and/or waypoints and print them in

                    templates to print tracks, routes, waypoints. These
                    templates are easy to write. Use command line switch
